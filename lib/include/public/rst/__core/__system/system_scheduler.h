     * @brief Manages and schedules execution of ECS systems across timing phases.
     *
     * @tparam THook Enumeration type defining execution timing/phases
     *
     * The system scheduler organizes systems into timing buckets and executes
     * them in a controlled manner. It provides the main execution framework
     * for the ECS architecture, ensuring systems run in the correct order
     * and have access to necessary engine resources.
     *
     * Features:
     * - Template-based design supporting any sequential enum for timing hooks
     * - Dynamic system registration with perfect forwarding of constructor arguments
     * - Batch execution of systems within timing phases
     * - Automatic lifetime management of registered systems
     * - Separation of concerns between system logic and scheduling
     *
     * Design Philosophy:
     * - Systems are grouped by logical execution phases (e.g., physics, render)
     * - Each timing phase can contain multiple systems
     * - Systems within a phase execute in registration order
     * - Scheduler manages system ownership via unique_ref smart pointers
     * - Registry and service locator are provided to all systems
     *
     * Usage:
     * @code
     * system_scheduler<system_timing> scheduler{registry, services};
     *
     * // Register systems for different timing phases
     * scheduler.register_system<physics_system>(system_timing::physics);
     * scheduler.register_system<renderer_system>(system_timing::render);
     * scheduler.register_system<input_system>(system_timing::early_tick);
     *
     * // Execute systems for specific timing phases
     * scheduler.signal_hook(system_timing::early_tick);
     * scheduler.signal_hook(system_timing::physics);
     * scheduler.signal_hook(system_timing::render);
     * @endcode
